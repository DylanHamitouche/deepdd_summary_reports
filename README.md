# Automating Actigraphy and REDCap Data Integration for Patient Summary Reports

The two scripts used to generate plots used to construct summary reports of sleep quality, physical activity levels, and symptom changes for participants enrolled in the Deep Phenotyping and Digitalization at Douglas (Deep-DD).
One script generates plots for the most recent month of actigraphy data collected, while the other generates plots for all the data collected since the begninning of the study.
The scripts are constructed such that only one execution generates plots for all participants for whom data (either actigraphy or REDCap) is collected and stored in the appropriate folders.
